Question:

Given that you have a 2 dimensional array of height values (say 10x10) that
represent a height field.Assume that the distance between each height point
in X and Y is 1 and that from the grid we form a triangulated mesh such that
for each set of 4 grid points A=(x,y), B=(x+1,y) C=(x+1,y+1), and D=(x,y+1)
there are two triangles ABC and ACD (so they are seperated by the line x=y
in the local coordinate system of the grid). Explain how you would find the
*exact* height of an arbitrary point x,y on this mesh. Feel free to reuse
the class you made for (3).

(7b)

Please implement your method in C++.

SOLUTION:
I didn't understand this question. Will need further clarification
