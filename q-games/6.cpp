Question:
Please make a class (or set of classes) that encapsulate the the standard
functionality required from a 3 element vector. The design should be object
oriented and protect its data members from public access. Please support
simple operations on the vector such as addition, subtraction,
multiplication and division as well as dot and cross product.
You can use/extend some of what you did for (3).


(6b)

Assuming that you had to optimise your vector class for operation on a
modern SIMD processor, explain how you would go about it and what issues you
would have to consider.How would you deal with the issue of supporting both
SIMD and non SIMD architectures with the same class?

SOLUTION:

*/

#include <iostream>

int main() {
	printf("Didn't have time to get to this one.\n");
}
